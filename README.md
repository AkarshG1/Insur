Insur mockups for Hex18

Insur is a peer to peer insurance system for low income individuals, eg. poor farmers, who don't have access to vaible insurance packages.
This repo currently however is basically a front end mockup that allows farmers to register with their phone numbers
and calls Twilio API to confirm registration, deliver SMS based adds etc.

Insur is meant to be a decentralised pool of insurers , where claims are validated by peers according to a certain framework of rules. 
This allows scalability, and keeps operating costs to a minimum. Given the decentralised nature of the system and the requirements for 
an electronic payment system, something like a blockchain would make sense.
